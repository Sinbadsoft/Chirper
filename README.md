            <add address="localhost" port="9160"/>
          </cassandraEndpoints>
        </endpointManager>
      </add>
    </clusters>
  </aquilesConfiguration>

create keyspace Chirper;
use Chirper;
create column family Users with comparator = UTF8Type;
create column family Tweets with comparator = UTF8Type;
